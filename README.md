# Liveticker

Inspired by [Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com/), Liveticker is a super-simple programming language to write code
that looks like a football (soccer) liveticker.
The source code is translated to Python code and then gets executed with Python.

## Installation

To run a program written in Liveticker you need to have Python 3 installed. No additional Python packages are needed
so far.
Then you just clone this repository and run the following command in your console:
`python /path/to/repo/liveticker.py --file /path/to/file.live`

## Examples

There are a few examples on how this programming language works in the `examples` folder.
